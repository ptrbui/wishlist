        i think it’d be <span class="red">fun</span> to turn this <span class="blue">list</span> into a <span class="green">game</span>.
        if i give you a <span class="purple">list</span> in which i simply tell you exactly what i <span class="orange">want</span>, the
        only tangible outcome is that you <span class="red">buy</span> those <span class="blue">things</span> that are on the <span class="green">list</span>
        and i know exactly what is going to <span class="purple">come</span> out of it. i open the <span class="orange">gifts</span> on the day of <span class="red">ss</span>,
        and pretend like i had no idea what was <span class="blue">coming</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        in past years, to add <span class="green">fun</span> to the boring thing that is a <span class="purple">christmas</span> wishlist, i’ve created burner accounts,
        interacted with (your) burner accounts, <span class="orange">pleaded</span> for the recovery of ong’s <span class="red">toes</span>, shared my <span class="blue">favorite</span> spiderman
        pictures, and so on. but those <span class="green">things</span> never gave <span class="purple">variation</span> to the outcome of my <span class="orange">gifts</span>. it made the process more
        interesting, but the idea of what i <span class="red">wanted</span>, as well as my <span class="blue">idea</span> of what i was going to receive was still pretty
        clear. i’d troll in one tweet, and in the next id say directly that a <span class="green">running</span> quarter zip would perhaps be a nice
        gift. i got the <span class="purple">quarter</span> zip.
    </p>
    <p>
        so how do i add <span class="orange">variation</span>? well i think the only way to do that is to add some sort of barrier in how my <span class="blue">list</span> is
        communicated. i try to give some sort of <span class="green">code</span> or hints, and it is up to you to <span class="purple">decode</span> those codes and hints.
        but what if you don’t perform well in this <span class="orange">game</span>? well the answer to that is that it doesn’t really <span class="red">matter</span>. in my
        burner that ive used for 3 years, it has always been clear that i had never really <span class="green">cared</span> about the gifts— that
        is, what they turned out to <span class="blue">be</span>, how much was spent, etc. what i have always enjoyed so much about ss was
        the effort and time that was <span class="purple">taken</span> to give to one another. at this point, if we actually really needed something
        that is $50 we’d have it shipped to our front <span class="orange">doors</span> within a few days. ss has always been about the time and
        <span class="red">generosity</span> that we’ve given to one another. it has never been about the physical <span class="blue">gifts</span>. so have fun, don't try to
        pick out exactly what i want. the best gift that you could possibly give (to anyone) is your interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ok i realized i went on a bit of a tangent there. ok, <span class="green">gifts</span>, variation, game, .. ah i see. so what kind of <span class="purple">game</span> could
        you possibly expect? what could i possibly do so that both you and i don’t know what the gifts are? well i’ll tell you
        this. i actually don’t know exactly what i <span class="orange">want</span>. at all. i never really do. but i know what i <span class="red">like</span>, and i think i can give you
        a few hints as to things that i <span class="blue">like</span>. maybe directly and/or <span class="green">indirectly</span>. idk.
    </p>
    <p>
        i’d say im pretty <span class="purple">excited</span> to see what the outcome of this is. be <span class="orange">creative</span>. be witty. have <span class="red">fun</span>, even
        ask your <span class="blue">friends</span> what they might <span class="green">think</span>. this <span class="purple">game</span> is my gift to you— an early thank you for what you may give to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you’ve read this far, i'm ahppy to tell you that you have already been playing the game all along. pay attention to what <span class="orange">words</span> are <span class="red">highlighted</span>
        when you hover over them. some things click to something, some don't. and one more thing. when deciding on what on i should title this list, i settled on 'wishlist'. it contains two of the letter s. for 'ss'. good <span class="blue">luck</span>.
