        i think it’d be <span class="red">really</span> fun to turn this list into a game. if i give you a list in which i simply tell you exactly what
        i want, the only tangible outcome is that you buy those things that are on the list and i know exactly what is going
        to come out of it. i open the gifts on the day of ss, and pretend like i had no idea what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
        in past years, to add fun to the boring thing that is a christmas wishlist, i’ve created burner accounts, interacted
        with (your) burner accounts, pleaded for the recovery of ong’s toes, shared my favorite spiderman pictures, and
        so on. but those things never gave variation to the outcome of my gifts. it made the process more interesting, but
        the idea of what i wanted, as well as my idea of what i was going to receive was still pretty clear. i’d troll in
        one tweet, and in the next id say directly that a running quarter zip would perhaps be a nice gift. i got the quarter
        zip.
    </p>
    <p>
        so how do i add variation? well i think the only way to do that is to add some sort of barrier in how my list is
        communicated. i try to give some sort of code or hints, and it is <span class="red">up</span> to you to decode those codes and hints. but
        what if you don’t perform well in this game? well the answer to that is that it doesn’t really matter. in my burner
        that ive used for 3 years, it has always been clear that i had never really cared about the gifts— that is, what
        they turned out to be, how much was spent, etc. what i have always enjoyed so much about ss was the effort and time
        that was taken to give to one another. at this point, if we actually really needed something that is $50 we’d have
        it shipped to our <span class="red">front</span> doors within a few days. ss has always been about the time and generosity that we’ve given
        to <span class="red">one</span> another. it has <span class="red">never</span> been about the physical gifts. so have fun, don't try to pick out exactly what i want.
        the best gift that you could possibly give (to anyone) is your interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
        ok i <span class="red">realized</span> i went on a bit of a tangent there. ok, gifts, variation, game, .. ah i see. so what kind of game
        could you possibly expect? what could i possibly do so that both you and i don’t know what the gifts are? well i’ll
        tell you this. i actually don’t know exactly what i want. at all. i never really do. but i know what i like, and
        i think i can give you a <span class="red">few</span> hints as to things that i like. maybe directly and/or indirectly. idk.
    </p>
    <p>
        i’d say im pretty excited to see what the outcome of this is. be creative. be witty. have <span class="red">ufun</span>, even ask your friends
        what they might think. this game is my gift to you— an early thank you for what you may give to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you’ve read this far, i'm happy to tell you that you have already been playing the game all along. pay attention
        to what words are highlighted when you hover over them. some things click to something, some don't. <span class="red">n</span> one more
        thing. when deciding on what on i should title this list, i settled on 'wishlist'. it contains two of the letter
        s. for 'ss'. good luck.
