        i think it’d be <span class="red">really</span> fun to turn this <span class="green">list</span> into a <span class="orange">game</span>. if i give you a list in which i simply tell you exactly what
        i want, the only <a href="https://www.nike.com/" class="blue" target="_blank">tangible</a> outcome is that you <span class="green">buy</span> those things that are on the <span class="orange">list</span> and i know exactly what is going
        to come out of it. i open the gifts on the day of ss, and pretend like i had no idea what was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
        in past years, to add fun to the <a href="https://www.backcountry.com/" class="blue" target="_blank">monotonous</a> thing that is a <span class="purple">christmas</span> wishlist, i’ve created burner accounts, interacted
        with (your) burner accounts, pleaded for the recovery of ong’s toes, shared my <span class="green">favorite</span> <span class="red">upictures</span>, and
        so on. but those things never gave variation to the outcome of my gifts. it made the process more interesting, but
        the idea of what i <span class="orange">wanted</span>, as well as my idea of what i was going to receive was still pretty clear. i’d troll in
        one tweet, and in the next id say directly that a <span class="purple">running</span> quarter zip would perhaps be a nice gift. i got the quarter
        zip.
    </p>
    <p>
        so how do i add <span class="purple">variation</span>? well i think the only way to do that is to add some sort of <span class="green">barrier</span> in how my list is
        <a href="https://www.rei.com/" class="blue" target="_blank">communicated</a>. i try to give some sort of <span class="purple">code</span> or hints, and it is up to you to decode those codes and hints. but
        what if you don’t perform well in this <span class="orange">game</span>? well the answer to that is that it doesn’t really matter. in my burner
        that ive used for 3 years, it has always been clear that i had never really <span class="green">cared</span> about the gifts— that is, what
        they turned out to be, how much was spent, etc. what i have always enjoyed so much about ss was the effort and time
        that was taken to <span class="orange">give</span> to one another. at this point, if we actually really needed something that is $50 we’d have
        it shipped to our front <span class="orange">doors</span> within a few days. ss has always been about the time and <span class="purple">generosity</span> that we’ve given
        to one another. it's <span class="red">never</span> been about the physical gifts. so have <span class="red">fun</span>, don't try to pick out exactly what i want.
        the best gift that you could possibly give (to anyone) is your <a href="https://teenage.engineering/" class="blue" target="_blank">interpretation</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="red">ok</span> i <span class="red">realized</span> i went on a bit of a tangent there. ok, gifts, <span class="purple">variation</span>, game, .. ah i see. so what kind of game
        could you possibly expect? what could i possibly do so that both you and i don’t know what the gifts are? well i’ll
        tell you this. i actually don’t know exactly what i want. at all. i never really do. but i know what i <span class="green">like</span>, and
        i think i can give you a <span class="red">few</span> hints as to things that i <span class="orange">like</span>. maybe directly and/or indirectly. idk.
    </p>
    <p>
        i’d say im pretty excited to see what the outcome of this is. use your <span class="purple">creativity</span>. be witty. have <span class="orange">fun</span>, even ask your friends
        what they might think. this game is my gift to you— an early thank you for what you may <span class="green">give</span> to me.
    </p>
    <p>
        if you’ve read this far, i'm happy to tell<span class="red"> u</span> that you have already been playing the <span class="orange">game</span> all along. pay attention
        to what words are <a href="https://www.keychron.com/" class="blue" target="_blank">highlighted</a> when you hover over them. some things click to something, some don't. oh-- <span class="red">nd</span> one more
        thing. when i was deciding on what on i should title this list, i settled on 'wishlist'. it contains two of the letter
        s. for 'ss'. good <span class="green">luck</span>.
